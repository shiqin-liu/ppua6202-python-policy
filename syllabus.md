# PPUA6202 Research Toolkit: Python for Policy

Northeastern University  
School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs  
Summer 1 2021  

Instructor: Shiqin Liu  
Email: liu.shiqi@northeastern.edu  
Format: asynchronous online  

## Course Description:

This course is intended for graduate students in public policy and public administration who have little or no programming experience. It provides students with an understanding of the Python programming language and introduce toolkits for use in public and nonprofit sector settings. The course is designed to help students feel confident of their ability to write small programs and accomplish professional goals. We will use Python and Jupyter notebook to introduce coding and practical application using Python that students can reproduce and experiment with.

## Prerequisites

This course proceeds from the ground up, and introduces all necessary concepts along the way. Students of all backgrounds are welcome if they are ready to put the work to acquire new skills on a weekly basis. Yet, it is important to note that this course will introduce programming toolkit for basic quantitative analysis, meaning that students will be better off coming with at least some familiarity (or willing to put in the hard work) with either statistics or programming.

## Course Format:

We follow a weekly structure, where each week consist of one or more modules of learning materials. All the online materials are contained within the course website on Canvas, and that is the primary platform through which the students will interact with the course content.

Each week, you will need to complete the reading materials, learning modules and assignments. Python coding exercises will be assigned for students each week to apply the concepts they learned in that week, building upon the concepts learned previous weeks.

In addition to the weekly assignment, there will be a final project that requires students to ask a critical research question and use policy-relevant data and practical tools learned from this course to help answer the question. It is easier to learn to code when you are trying to solve a problem you care about. So, find a problem you care about!

Guidelines for completing and submitting each assignment will be posted along with the weekly module. All due dates and times are in Eastern Standard Time (EST), so plan to complete all assignments accordingly. Please note that if you are unable to complete an assignment within the time period provided, a documented compelling excuse is required prior to the deadline. For excuses to be valid they have to anticipate the due date, except for unavoidable emergencies. Otherwise, late submissions that are not properly excused will be discounted by 25% of the total grade per each late day.

## Course Objectives:

This course is based on the practical aspects of learning the basics of Python and applying it for use in the public and nonprofit settings. By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand the basic Python programming language and its uses
  - Common data types
  - Functions
  - How to read documentation
  - How to troubleshoot
- Write simple code and know several useful python packages to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data
- Feel comfortable learning new techniques and new Python libraries on your own
- Apply Python in practical application settings to answer relevant public policy questions

**Materials:** Coursework will be based on free open-source software.

- Downey AB. _Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Second Edition, Version 2e_. (Green Tea Press and O&#39;Reilly, 2018). This is an open textbook, available for free at [GreenTeaPress.com/wp/think-python-2e/](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/).

- McKinney, W., &amp; Safari, _Python for Data Analysis_ (O&#39;Reilly Media Company, 2012). Available as e-book from NEU library

Other copyrighted course reading materials are available via the course Canvas site for enrolled students to download.

## Evaluation and Grading:

The course grade is based on the following:

- Participation: 10% (ask/answer questions, post/share resources, engage discussion)
  - Asking good questions is an important and demanding skill. You will receive credit both for questions that demonstrate effort, as well as for answering your classmates&#39;
  - Asking questions in a public forum means that we do not have to answer the same questions repeatedly
- 6 weekly assignment: 60% (10% each)
  - These will be graded on the following criteria: Your code does what it&#39;s supposed to do and you correctly answer the question (60%). Your code can fully run without any error (20%). Your code is well-commented and documented (15%) Your code is clear, straightforward, and reasonably efficient (5%)
  - All weekly assignments are due the following Monday by 23:59pm (ETS Time) via Canvas submission from the week that is assigned.
- Final project: 30%
  - Details will follow mid-way through the term

## Course Requirements:

Students are expected to complete readings, class modules, participate in discussion, and submit weekly assignments and final project. Important information will be distributed through the course site and via email. It is important that you check your email regularly.

Technology Requirements

- Students will need access to a laptop, Windows or Mac (Linux is OK, but note that since I do not use it, I may not be able to help you with issues related to the operating system), with internet connectivity.
- This course will be taught in the open-source programming language Python (version 3) and the programming environment Jupyter.
- Software installation will be instructed prior to the first week module. Try your very best to have this done before you start the course lecture.
  - Anaconda
  - Atom

## If you have questions:

- Check the reading, lecture materials or Python Documentation
- Ask Google: &quot;Python 3 how do I nnnn&quot;
- Search and read carefully on StackOverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you are struggling with or the error message), see [How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
- Post on discussion forum on Canvas with a detailed description of what you are trying to do, what is not working
- Email or Office hours by appointment

## Code of conduct

Students must adhere to Northeastern University honor code. Writing code is different from writing essays: it is standard practice to find individual functions or google things that don not work, and copy a line or two from the manual or stack overflow. You can discuss or work with each other in the course to solve homework problems, yet you absolutely should not copy code from your classmates. Your work should be original. Plagiarism, copying from other students, or submitting the work of someone not in the program are grounds for expulsion from the course.

## Anti-discrimination policy

Northeastern is committed to providing equal opportunity to its students and employees, and to eliminating discrimination when it occurs.  In furtherance of this commitment, the University strictly prohibits discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, religious creed, genetic information, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran, or disability status. The Northeastern University [Title IX policy](http://www.northeastern.edu/policies/pdfs/Title_IX_Policy.pdf) articulates how the University will respond to reported allegations of sexual harassment involving students, including sexual assault, and provides a consolidated statement of the rights and responsibilities under University policies and Title IX, as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.

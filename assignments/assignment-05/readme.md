# Python for Policy
# Assignment 5

Due next Monday night by 23:59pm via Canvas submission.

In this assignment, you will get your hands on a spatial data. Follow the instructions below to complete the assignment:

1. Download a spatial dataset(s) of your choice (from Cesus TIGER, via API, or python packadge OSMnx etc.), clean and process the data as needed.

2. Using the mapping techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data. Create at least 3 static maps. These maps can be plotted with geopandas directly or with python packages we learned from the lecture. Each map should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains what you are visualizing and why it is interesting.

Try to use datasets and conduct analysis in this assignment that would benefit your final project (but it is not required). Your analysis should be done in a single notebook. Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Then submit your notebook and your data file, zipped, via Blackboard.

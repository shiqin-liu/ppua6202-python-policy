Due next Monday night June 28 by 23:59pm via Canvas submission.  

In this assignment, you will need to 1) run through this week's lecture notebook; 2) complete the "now your turn" exercises within the lecture notebook. Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the outputs and visuals can be seen inline. Then submit your notebook via Canvas.   

This is a relatively simple assignment compared to the previous ones. I would like you to take some time to read through what is going on in the lecture. While there’s not enough time to thoroughly introduce the statistics concepts and the feature packages, you are encouraged to explore the web and readings to find out more about them, and think about how to apply statistical modeling to your own project.   

You are welcome to use the General Discussion forum for this assignment. If you have questions you don’t mind making public. You are also welcome to email me with any questions or problems that you may have.

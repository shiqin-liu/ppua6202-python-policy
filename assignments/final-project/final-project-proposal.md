# Python for Policy
# Final Project Proposal 

Due next Monday night June 14 by 23:59pm via Canvas submission.

Different from previous assignments, this week you will start to think about the topic and dataset(s) for your final project. This week's lecture is introduced to help you start exploring the potential datasets, but feel free to explore your own path beyond the lecture resources.

The final project is a cumulative and applied assignment that requires you to use the skills you developed over the entire semester. You need to develop a research question(s) of your interest that can be answered using the visualization, descriptive analysis, mapping, or statistical modeling methods learned in this course. Please take a look at the final project instructions for more details: ppua6202-final-project.

For this proposal, please submit a one-page paper explaining your project idea, the motivation, and identify at least one potential data sets and download them, how you will process it, and how you will visualize it. What sort of findings do you expect? What new insights will they provide? Then submit your dataset(s) and the paper as a PDF via Canvas.

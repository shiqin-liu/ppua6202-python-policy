# Python for Policy
# Assignment 1

Due next Monday night by 23:59pm via Canvas submission.

In this assignment, you will create a Jupyter notebook to work with basic object and data types, and do basic math operation.

This is to ensure you 1) successfully install the required software, and know how to 2) create a Jupyter Notebook and write python code for basic operation we learned this week

Create a new, clean Jupyter Notebook, do the following:
   1. The first cell in your notebook should be a markdown cell with heading "Assignment 1", and your name in text.
   2. Do the math, calculate the area of a circle:
      - You are given two variables: pi = 3.14159; diameter = 3
      - Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
      - Create a variable called 'area', calculate the area using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
      - Convert the answer to integer, and print it with an appropriate message, such as "The approximate area of the circle is XX"


Give your them meaningful filenames like `your-lastname-assignment0.ipynb`. Submit your notebook and python script file as Assignment 1 on Canvas by Monday night. Before submitting, confirm the following to the best of your abilities: does your code fully run? Does it do what it's supposed to do the way it's supposed to do it? Is it well-commented and documented? Is your code clear, straightforward, and reasonably efficient? (These apply to every assignment we do throughout the semester)

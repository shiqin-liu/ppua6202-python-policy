# Python for Policy
# Assignment 4

Due next Monday night by 23:59pm via Canvas submission.

In this assignment, you can continue to work with the data set from today's lecture, or use some data sets you're working with elsewhere in life. you will create a new, clean Jupyter notebook to contain your submission and follow the instructions below to complete the assignment:  

1. The first cell in your notebook should be a markdown cell containing a plain-English narrative of the dataset you are using and a brief description of the analysis you are planning to do.  

2. load and clean the dataset using pandas and the techniques we learned from previous lectures.  

3. conduct some basic descriptive analysis for at least two variables of your choice, followed by comments or a markdown cell to interprete your results.  

4. use the matplotlib or seaborn techniques we learned in class, create at least 3 different visualization types (such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, or anything else). If you are using your own dataset, explain the variable you used. If you are working with the dataset from the lecture, choose different variables for visualization other than the one used in the lecture notebook (you will not get points if you just recreate what is presented in the module lecture). Each visualization should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains what you are visualizing and why it is interesting.    

All analysis should be done in a single notebook. Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook).  Give it meaningful filenames like `your-lastname-assignment4.ipynb`.

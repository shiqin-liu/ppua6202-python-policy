    "\n",
    "GIS stands for geographic information system, a multi-component environment used to create, manage, visualize and analyze data and its spatial counterpart. Points, Lines and Polygons are three basic spatial elements of GIS vector data. GIS software lets you work with spatial data, that is, data associated with locations on the Earth. These locations are represented with coordinates: longitude (x), latitude (y), and often elevation (z). With GIS software you can collect, edit, query, analyze, and visualize spatial data. Examples of GIS software include ArcGIS, QGIS, and GeoPandas. \n",

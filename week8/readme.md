# Week8 overview

## Final project
The final project is a cumulative and applied assignment that requires you to use the skills you developed over the entire semester. You need to develop a research question(s) of your interest that can be answered using the visualization, descriptive analysis, mapping, or statistical modeling methods learned in this course.    

Please take a look at the final project instructions at the assignment folder for more details: ppua6202-final-project.   

Final projects are due June 30 via Canvas: Please submit a zip file containing the 1) the narrative (as PDF), 2) your visualization or map image files, and 3) the Jupyter notebook(s) and 4) data files used to complete this project. Make sure everything is runnable and reproducible.   

Grading is based on:   
Project Scope: your research questions is relevant to public interests and could be answered through the lens of data and python tools.   
Completeness: your project meet the minimum requirements from the instructions (data visualization, maps, stats analysis etc.); your write-up include all five sections (introduction, methods, results and discussion)  
Correctness: your code produces the outputs that you plan to do, and can run without error and relatively efficient
Documentation: your code are well-documented; you clearly explain your data and methods, and interpret your results in a meaningful way.  

You are welcome to use the General Discussion forum for this final project if you have questions, ideas or thoughts you would like to share. If you have questions you donâ€™t mind making public. You are also welcome to email me with any questions or concerns that you may have.

    "This course is intended for graduate students in public policy and related fields who have little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the Python programming language and introduce toolkits for use in public and nonprofit sector settings. This course proceeds from the ground up, and introduces all of the necessary concepts along the way. Students of all backgrounds are welcome if they are ready to put in the hard work to acquire new skills on a weekly basis!"
